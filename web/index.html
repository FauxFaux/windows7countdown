            <p>That's right. Your favourite legacy operating system isn't long for this world.</p>
            <p>I, for one, will be celebrating Windows 7 passing into obsolescence, and falling out of use.
                Much like we celebrated the
                <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/ie6countdown/">demise of IE6</a>,
                and the eventual
                <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/end-of-xp-support">downfall of Windows
                    XP</a>. I hope you joined us for that.
            </p>
            <p>You've had over five years (and counting!) to voluntarily switch to a newer, better operating system.
                Finally, the time is coming where you'll be forced to join us in the future, or suffer from lack of
                support for newer hardware, a cessation of developers suffering old tools to support you,
                and a continually increasing security risk.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h2 class="complaint">&ldquo;But change is bad!&rdquo;</h2>
            <p>You don't like new things, I get it.
                You can think of plenty of justifications how upgrading is a minor inconvenience to you. You've
                found a synthetic benchmark that shows that some particular task is slower. You don't like the
                colour of the buttons.</p>
            <p>The world moves on. Technology gets better. Things change. People complain.
                It is the way of the world. Luckily, in this case, you have no choice; you cannot prevent us
                from inventing the automobile as you're too obsessed with your prize horse. You cannot prevent
                us from curing disease because you've heard <em>complete lies</em> about how vaccines are bad.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h2 class="complaint">&ldquo;It's expensive!&rdquo;</h2>
            <p>You had a year to claim a
                <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12435/windows-10-upgrade-faq">free upgrade</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Assuming you run it for the full 7 years left, Windows 10 costs around ¼th of what Office costs
                <em>every year</em>. Around ⅛th (<em>every year</em>) of the software I am writing this document with.
                ⅛th (<em>every year</em>) of Photoshop. <em>3%</em> (<em>every year!</em>) of the cheapest commercial
                development kit for Windows. I suspect you use Windows more than these.</p>
            <p>If you're using Windows 7 (or earlier!) on a consumer laptop, you're almost certainly better off
                just buying a new laptop; the improvement you will see will be immense.</p>
            <a name="chart"></a>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-4"><img src="win7chart.png" alt="Win7's decline vs. supported OSes"/></div>
        <div class="col-sm-8">
            <h2 class="complaint">&ldquo;It'll never die!&rdquo; <a href="#chart">&#128279;</a></h2>
            <p class="complaint">
                Microsoft won't let me down! They'll extend support indefinitely for free for my
                favourite OS!
            </p>
            <p>This chart shows the current progress of Windows 7 being replaced, according to
                <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-201501-201801">StatCounter</a>.
            </p>

            <p>The blue, significantly upwards trending line, is the percentage of people using modern, supported
                operating systems.</p>

            <p>The red, significantly downwards trending line, is the percentage of people using Windows 7.</p>

            <p>The X-axis shows "months until end of support". This might seem like an odd choice, but it allows
                us to make an easy comparison to the Windows XP version of this graph, below.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-8">
            <h2 class="complaint">&ldquo;The trend will stop, people will stop upgrading!&rdquo;</h2>
            <p>I don't really know why anyone would think this. There's going to be some people who never
                upgrade, but those people aren't interesting; so long as there's few enough of them, they will
                be forever forgotten.</p>

            <p>But, just in case, here's a chart showing the same data, but leading up to Windows XP's end of
                life, in 2014.</p>

            <p>Looks pretty much the same to me. Maybe the trend shallows out a bit right at the end, but
                before then it <em>speeds up</em> for a bit, as the panic sets in.</p>

            <p>See how the crossing point, where the lines meet at around 50%, is at almost exactly the
                same time before the end of life on both charts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4"><img src="winxpchart.png" alt="WinXP's decline vs. supported OSes"/></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h2 class="complaint">&ldquo;Microsoft will extend free support!&rdquo;</h2>
            <p>I feel they would only do this if it looked like there were to be an unreasonable number of
                unsupported users after the end of support. The above charts do not predict this.</p>

            <p>XP was extended for two years. At its original End of Life date, it would have had 36% market
                share. Windows 7 could have below 25%. Perhaps they'll offer some critical patches for the
                first six months? A year? Good luck with that.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h2 class="complaint">&ldquo;Developers will continue supporting me!&rdquo;</h2>
            <p>XP was dropped by developers as the usage dropped off, as will happen with Windows 7.</p>
            <p>Games started dropping support long before the end of life date. There are plenty of
                Windows 10 only games today (but this is mostly Microsoft being weird).</p>
            <p>Chrome dropped support two years after the end of life date.
                Firefox dropped support after three years. Java (which was relevant at the time!)
                dropped support immediately.</p>
